# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
Models are responsible for communicating with the database, validate data and store the data received by the client. I think it is similar to the API we had for our project.
```

## Define Controller Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
Controllers are responsible for taking specific requests both for the server and the client. It is "the middle man" that knows who to pass information to (the view or the model).
```

## Define Router Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
The router recognizes URLs and breaks them to pass to the controller, so the controller will know how to serve the info it is accessing.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
The client makes a GET request to the Web Browser. The browser routes that information to the controller. The controller will then get the information needed from model and view and send it back to the Web Server and the Browser. Model being responsible to deliver the data and view being responsible for updating the browser with HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
```
